# dog_vs_cat
### Using pytorch and transfer learning to achieve a cat and dog classifier.
In this project, using VGG-16 to conduct transfer learning. The val set is used to verify whether my model works well. Eventually getting a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that can identify cat and dog pictures.
